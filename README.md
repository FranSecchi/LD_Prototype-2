Following the Level Design activity 1, we were asked to create a new level for a non-fixed camera, 3D singleplayer game with a start
and an ending.

So we designed a new game with its own GDD and started creating its first level.

- Check *A2 - LD Protoype* to see the actual activity request's.
- Check *LD_P2_LDD* to read the results of the level design.
- Check *LD_P2_GDD* to understand the game which the LDD is based on.
